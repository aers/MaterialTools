# MaterialTools

XivLauncher plugin for functions modifying how the game loads materials for models.

## Features

* Skin Material Override 
  
  Overrides the default handling of skin materials so that all races and clans are allowed variants. When the plugin is loaded, it will scan for race variants (cXXXXb0001) and clan variants (cXXXXb0101) in your dat files, and enable variants that are found. You can use the "Show Skin Material List" button to see a list of all materials that are being used for the skin resolver.
